    $ cd patternlab-base-toolkit

You can now access the website at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Technical bits

There are some major differences from the original project, namely:

- SASS compilation
- Directory structure
- Improved code standards to be used throughout the project

### SASS compilation

The `gulpfile.js` will automatically compile, inject, and reload the browser upon changes to any of the `*.scss` files available in the directory `/source/sass/`.

# TODO

- [ ] Add support for autoprefixer when compiling SCSS files.
- [ ] Add support for normalize
- [x] Add support for automatic SASS linting via stylelint.
