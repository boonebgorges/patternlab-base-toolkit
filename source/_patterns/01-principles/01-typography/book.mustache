<h3>How to build a Paddling Dory</h3>

<blockquote>A Simple Boat Which Any One Can Build &mdash; The Cheapest Sort of a Boat</blockquote>

<p>To construct this craft it is, of course, necessary that we shall have some lumber, but we will use the smallest amount and the expense will come within the limits of a small purse.</p>

<p>First we must have two boards, their lengths depending upon circumstances and the lumber available. The ones in the diagram are supposed to be of pine to measure (after being trimmed) 18 feet long by 18 inches wide and about 1 inch thick. When the boards are trimmed down so as to be exact duplicates of each other, place one board over the other so that their edges all fit exactly and then nail each end of the two boards together for the distance of about six inches. Turn the boards over and nail them upon the opposite side in the same manner, clamping the nail ends if they protrude. Do this by holding the head of a hammer or a stone against the heads of the nails while you hold a wire nail against the protruding end, and with a hammer bend it over the nail until it can be mashed flat against the board so that it will not project beyond its surface.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>The landlubber's chapter</h3>

<blockquote>Common Nautical Terms and Expressions Defined &mdash; <em>How to Sail a Boat</em> &mdash; <em>Boat Rigs</em> &mdash; <em>Rowing-clothes</em> &mdash; <em>How to Make a Bathing-suit</em> &mdash; <em>How to Avoid Sunburn</em></blockquote>

<p>There are a few common terms with which all who venture on the water should be familiar, not only for convenience, but for prudential reasons.</p>

<p>Accidents are liable to happen to boats of all descriptions, and often the safety of property and life depend upon the passengers' ability to understand what is said to them by the officers or sailors in charge of the craft.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with the water and shipping it may seem absurd to define the bow and stern of a boat, but there are people who will read this book who cannot tell the bow from the stern, so we will begin this chapter with the statement that</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The bow</strong> is the front end of the boat, and</li>
  <li><strong>The stern</strong> is the rear end of the boat.</li>
  <li><strong>For'ard</strong> is toward the bow of the boat.</li>
  <li><strong>Aft</strong> is toward the stern of the boat. Both terms are used by sailors as forward and backward are used by landsmen.</li>
  <li><strong>The hull</strong> is the boat itself without masts, spars, or rigging. A skiff and a birch-bark canoe are hulls.</li>
  <li><strong>The keel</strong> is the piece of timber running along the centre of the bottom of the hull, like the runner of a skate, and used to give the boat a hold on the water, so that she will not slide sideways.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are sitting in the stern of a boat, facing the bow, the side next to your right hand is the right-hand side of the boat,[75] and the side next to your left hand is the left-hand side of the boat. But these terms are not used by seamen; they always say</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Starboard</strong> for the right-hand side of the boat, and</li>
  <li><strong>Port</strong> for the left-hand side of the boat. Formerly the left-hand side was called the larboard, but this occasioned many serious mistakes on account of the similarity of the sound of larboard and starboard when used in giving orders.</li>
</ul>
